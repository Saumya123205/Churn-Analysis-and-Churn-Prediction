# Data-Driven Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction:
  Python + Machine Learniing + SQL + Power BI +  Excel
  
📊 Churn Prediction Project
🔹 This project focuses on building a predictive model to identify customers likely to churn in a telecom business. The aim is to enable proactive customer retention  strategies by leveraging historical customer data.

🔍 Project Overview
🔹 Using a combination of Python, SQL, Excel, and Power BI, this end-to-end project analyzes customer behavior and predicts churn with high accuracy. The workflow includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training using a Random Forest Classifier, and post-model analysis with business intelligence tools for actionable insights.

💡 Key Highlights
  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
🔹 Handled missing values and encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
🔹 Removed irrelevant columns such as Customer_ID, Churn_Category, and Churn_Reason.

Model Building:
🔹 Trained a Random Forest Classifier achieving an accuracy of 84.19%.
🔹 Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix and classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).

Feature Importance:
🔹 Identified the most influential features driving churn through model-based importance scoring.

Prediction:
🔹 Applied the trained model to new customer data and flagged high-risk customers likely to churn.

SQL Integration:
🔹 Performed data exploration and cleansing using SQL queries.
🔹 Created views to segment data (vw_ChurnData, vw_JoinData) and supported the ML pipeline.

Power BI Dashboard:
🔹 Built an interactive dashboard to visualize churn patterns by gender, contract type, state, and other variables.
🔹 Enabled business users to monitor churn KPIs and filter insights dynamically.
